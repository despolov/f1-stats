# TODO

- driver colors should be based on the selected year and race due to driver swaps mid season
- fix header in Spanish locale
- fix practice stats table when locale is not en

- Race stats
  mobile version needed
  add more stats there

- Home route
  buttons under the hero image are not clickable

- Articles section in the Home route
  desktop - articles on right, fast route clicks on left
  mobile - ?
  on click - new route with the article there. Image, title and content

- Qualifying results overview - chart like the ones in the Practice stats, just showing how faster a car in comparison to the others

- Tyre strategies during a race - I think we can calculate that based on the stints that we already have
