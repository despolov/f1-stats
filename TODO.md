# TODO

- All Stints button not working in Tyres route
- fix practice stats table when locale is not en

- download Practice stats, race stats, tyres and stints as json/csv or whatever, to use it for the articles later

- Articles section in the Home route
  desktop - articles on right, fast route clicks on left
  mobile - ?
  on click - new route with the article there. Image, title and content

- Race stats
  mobile version needed
  add more stats there

- Qualifying results overview - chart like the ones in the Practice stats, just showing how faster a car in comparison to the others

- Tyre strategies during a race - I think we can calculate that based on the stints that we already have
