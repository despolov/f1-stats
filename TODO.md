# TODO

- fix header in Spanish locale
- fix practice stats table when locale is not en

- better Footer

- Race stats
  mobile version needed
  add more stats there

- Articles section in the Home route
  desktop - articles on right, fast route clicks on left
  mobile - ?
  on click - new route with the article there. Image, title and content

- Qualifying results overview - chart like the ones in the Practice stats, just showing how faster a car in comparison to the others

- Tyre strategies during a race - I think we can calculate that based on the stints that we already have
